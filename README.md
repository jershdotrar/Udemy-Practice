# Practice / Online coursework
This is a repository of both general practice and Udemy coursework I either wanted on my portfolio while job searching, or to save for future reference.

## Practice
Much of this repo is practice work and experiments I wanted to keep for future reference for various projects I'm planning.

- State module practice
- Async playground
- etc

## Coursework
Most of what I have pushed here is from various Udemy courses, both code-along and open ended tests.
